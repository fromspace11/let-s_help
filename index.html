        <h1>Our Donate Plan</h1>
        <p>At first we will work on basic needs, like Food, Shelter, Medicine etc. and then if we get enough funding, we
            will work on other
            things. But it totally depends on your donations. So, donate as much as you can, and save others. </p>

            <p>Safe food and water supplies are a major concern following a natural disaster such as flood or tornado.
                We'll provide enough food and safe water to keep people alive. A 3- to 5-day supply of food and water
                can be a great help the affected people. </p>

                households are forced to leave and search for a place to carry on with their lives and livelihoods.
                We'll try to give them a safe shelter.</p>

                individuals some emergency medication.

            <h1>Their lives depend on your donation</h1>
            <p>Living through a flood when trapped is difficult. Losing everything in the flood and without clean water,
                food, clothing, shelter, and medical supplies makes it impossible to escape this catastrophe without
                assistance from others. They require a significant amount of funding to meet their basic necessities in
                this situation. Their survival ultimately depends on your donation.</p>

            <p>Living through a flood gets more difficult because more diseases are spreading quickly and affecting more
                individuals at this time. Floods can accelerate the spread of viral diseases, particularly those that
                are vector-borne and are water-borne, such yellow fever, west Nile fever (WNF), and dengue fever. Floods
                can also spread airborne infections and hepatitis A and E.</p>
